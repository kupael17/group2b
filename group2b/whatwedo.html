				In helping people with disabilities. There are many routes we can take. Simply learning how to effectively communicate comes first. 

				Often times, people with disabilities are assisted by interpreters, nurses, or friends during their day-to-day lives. It's important that, when communicating with some with a disability, you talk directly to that person. Do not filter conversation through someone else.

				Be Respectul in you words and actions. 

				When interacting with someone with a disability, always be respectful in both your words and actions.
